Stromusic is a cross-platform desktop client built for Subsonic-API (and Jellyfin in 0.8.0+) compatible music servers. This project was inspired by the many existing clients, but aimed to address a few key issues including <strong>scalability</strong>, <strong>library management</strong>, and <strong>user experience</strong>.

- [**Usage documentation & FAQ**](https://github.com/Ulyssedev/StroMusic/discussions/15)
- [**Theming documentation**](https://github.com/Ulyssedev/StroMusic/discussions/61)

Stromusic has been tested on the following: [Navidrome](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome), [Airsonic](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic), [Airsonic-Advanced](https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced), [Gonic](https://github.com/sentriz/gonic), [Astiga](https://asti.ga/), [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin)

### [Demo Stromusic using Navidrome](https://github.com/Ulyssedev/StroMusic/discussions/244)

## Features

- HTML5 audio with crossfading and gapless\* playback
- Drag and drop rows with multi-select
- Modify and save playlists intuitively
- Handles large playlists and queues
- Global mediakeys (and partial MPRIS) support
- Multi-theme support
- Supports all Subsonic/Jellyfin API compatible servers
- Built with Electron, React with the [rsuite v4](https://github.com/rsuite/rsuite) component library

<h5>* Gapless playback is artifically created using the crossfading players so it may not be perfect, YMMV.</h5>

## Development / Contributing

This project is built off of [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate) v2.3.0.
If you want to contribute to this project, please first create an [issue](https://github.com/Ulyssedev/StroMusic/issues/new) or [discussion](https://github.com/Ulyssedev/StroMusic/discussions/new) so that we can both discuss the idea and its feasability for integration.

yarn install
```

Start the app in the `dev` environment:

```bash
yarn start
```

To package apps for the local platform:
